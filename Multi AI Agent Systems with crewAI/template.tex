\begin{proof}
    This is the proof.
    \[
    \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2 \sqrt{2}.

    This is a lemma.

See \lemref{second}.

\begin{definition}

    A number is a \emphi{number}.

    Remarks are useful sometime.

\section{Mental framwork for agent creation}
Some math:
\begin{equation*}
    \Var{X}%
    =%
    \Ex{(X - \Ex{X})^2}.
\end{equation*}

Some definitions.
\begin{defn}
    \deflab{prime}%
    %
    An integer number $p > 1$ is \emphi{prime} if it is divisible
    only by $1$ or itself.
\end{defn}

A theorem:
\begin{theorem}
    \thmlab{main}% Label for the theorm
    %
    The number of primes is unbounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Assume for the sake of contradiction that the number of primes is
    finite, say $k$, and let $1 < p_1< p_2 < \cdots < p_k$ be these
    primes. Observe that $N = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_k +1 > 1$ is
    indivisible by $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, and is larger than all these
    numbers. Thus, $N$ must be prime. A contradiction.
\end{proof}

\defref{prime} and \thmref{main} were both known to the Greeks. Well,
to some of the Greeks.

I prefer to use \texttt{enumitem} for creating lists:
\begin{compactenumI}
    \smallskip%
    \item One can create more compact lists.

    \smallskip%
    \item There is more control over labels.
\end{compactenumI}
\smallskip%
And another good reason is because:
\begin{compactenumI}[resume]
    \smallskip%
    \item One can resume the numbering.
\end{compactenumI}

\bigskip%

It is usually a good idea to let \LaTeX{} do its thing. Do not use
\textbackslash\textbackslash{} to end lines (common mistakes for
\LaTeX{} beginners). End a paragraph by having an empty line. If you
want a big space between two paragraphs, just put
\texttt{\textbackslash{big{}skip}} in a line on its own between th two
paragraphs.

\bigskip

Just like that.


\paragraph{Paragraphs.}

I like to title my paragraphs so that people know what the paragraph
is about. This is a personal style thing, as area lot of other writing
stuff. Follow what you like. More sectioning commands follow. If you
comment out the
\texttt{\textbackslash{}def\textbackslash{}UseBibLatex{1}} then the
system would use bibtex instead.

    This is a lemma.

\section{Bibliography}

Nowadays, I like to use \texttt{biblatex}, but it is somewhat more
painful to use than \texttt{bibtex}. The big advantage of
\texttt{biblatex} that it is highly configurable if you are willing to
spend the energy to learn it. It does much better work than
\texttt{bibtex}. I highly recommend getting your bibtex entry from
DBLP, since they have the \texttt{doi} information -- this implies
that you get a link to the paper in \texttt{biblatex} or
\texttt{bibtex} if you use the right style.

Anyway, here is an example of a citation \cite{k-spda-10}.
